## Troubleshooting access denied issues

This page is here to troubleshoot access denied issues you run into when using `org-formation`. typically this has to do with a misconfigured or missing `OrganizationAccountAccessRole`.

#### I just created the account using org-formation

Please rerun the process: as all things AWS are eventually consistent it could be that the `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` still needs to be created.

Do let me know in [the issues](https://github.com/OlafConijn/AwsOrganizationFormation/issues) if this problem doesn't resolve on its own or if you run into this a lot!

#### I have an account that joined my organization

It could be that the `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` is missing. please log into the account and create the Role manually. There is a CloudFormation template at the bottom of this page.

#### CloudFormation template to create the OrganizationAccountAccessRole

**Note**: if you copied the `DenyChangeOfOrgRoleSCP` Policy from the [example organization](../examples/organization.yml) to your organization, make sure you temporarily detach it. Otherwise CloudFormation will fail with an `explicit deny`.

If you did not copy the `DenyChangeOfOrgRoleSCP` Policy into your organization, you might want to consider this. It explicitly denies anyone to change the Role below.
